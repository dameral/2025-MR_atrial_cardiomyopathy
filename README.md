### Abstract

**Atrial Fibrillation** (AF) is associated with pathological remodeling of the atria, a condition known as atrial myopathy, which is characterized by increased tissue stiffness and atrial dilation. Atrial myopathy involves various cell types, including cardiac myocytes, endothelial cells, and immune cells, which secrete inflammatory cytokines and pro-fibrotic factors like connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). These factors activate (myo)fibroblasts, resulting in interstitial fibrosis. Cardiac myocytes undergo electrophysiological remodeling, altering the activity of ion channels and calcium handling proteins. Atrial myopathy forms the substrate for an increased risk of AF onset, which is further perpetuated by AF itself.

Atrial myopathy can be induced by risk factors such as aging, hypertension, obesity, or heart failure. Aldosterone and its main target, the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), drive pathological remodeling in heart failure and may play a role in atrial myopathy as well. A recent meta-analysis indicated a 24% reduction in the risk of AF events in patients treated with MR antagonists.

The aim of this study was to:
1. Investigate whether aldosterone induces typical characteristics of atrial myopathy in mice.
2. Analyze associated changes in gene expression and cell-cell communication at single-cell resolution.

### Methodology

Adult male and female **C57BL/6N wildtype mice** were treated with aldosterone plus salt (**ALDO**, 500 µg/kg/d from osmotic minipumps, 1% NaCl in drinking water, n = 12) and compared to untreated controls (**CTRL**, n = 11). 

After two weeks, **echocardiography** revealed ALDO-induced left atrial (LA) dilatation, interstitial fibrosis (sirius red positive area ALDO 28 ± 2 % vs. CTRL 21 ± 1 %, P<0.01), and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (cross-sectional area ALDO 149 ± 8 mm² vs. CTRL 111 ± 7 mm²; P<0.01). 

This was associated with **left ventricular diastolic dysfunction** (mitral valve E/A) and spontaneous **supraventricular arrhythmia** in 7/12 ALDO-treated mice.

### Cellular and Molecular Analysis

In order to determine the cellular and molecular processes involved in ALDO-induced atrial myopathy, **single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq)** was performed. After tissue homogenization and nuclei purification, 30,193 nuclei with a median of 1,564 genes detected per nucleus were retained.

Unsupervised clustering indicated separation of cardiac myocytes from ALDO and CTRL hearts, with greatest expression of MR (Nr3c2) detected in **endothelial cells** and **cardiac myocytes**. Four distinct subclusters of cardiac myocytes were identified. Cardiac myocytes from ALDO-treated hearts showed higher expression of typical marker genes for **cardiac hypertrophy** and **fibrosis** such as natriuretic peptide precursor B (Nppb) and Ctgf.

### Cell-Cell Communication

Cell-cell communication analysis using **CellChat** revealed emerging interactions from cardiac myocytes to fibroblasts and T cells, predominantly via integrin and growth factor signaling. 

An increase in the number and strength of predicted interactions between T cells and fibroblasts was observed after ALDO treatment, which should be investigated further in future studies.

### Conclusion

Aldosterone treatment induces structural atrial remodeling and increases the risk for atrial arrhythmia, mimicking typical characteristics of atrial myopathy in mice. Single nucleus RNA-seq indicates that aldosterone predominantly affects cardiac myocytes, fibroblasts, and T cells and their cell-cell communication in atrial remodeling.
